					<h2>What I do</h2>
					<p>
						Lots of my professional experiences revolve around softwares written
						for the physical world industries such as Aerospace and Defense. In my previous job,
						I maintained a web application connected to devices
						that measure indoor air quality in real time. Now, I work on Filecoin at CIDgravity.
					</p>
					<p>
						I always try to code in the language the most suitable for each
						project, regardless of my current knowledge and preferences. I am
						currently most experienced in Java, Kotlin, Go and Python.
					</p>
					<p>
						{" "}
						I occasionally {" "}
						<Link to={siteConfig.userGitHub}>
							get involved in open-source projects
						</Link>
						. I love tweaking my{" "}
						<Link to="https://github.com/nicobao/setup/tree/master/vim">

						, and I spend lots of my time learning about the new technology and
						business trends.

					<h2>My values</h2>
					<p>
						I am the no bullshit type. Solid code and transparency are what
						matters to me. I measure quality by customer satisfaction. I donâ€™t
						hesitate asking questions - I do it happily as part of team work.
					</p>
					<p>
						My fuel is passion. I enjoy the most working on meaningful and
						ambitious projects.

					<h2>Why Baozi?</h2>
					<p>
						Because it is so damn tasty! What a question! And also because it
						appears simple but it is internally extremely complex like all
						pieces of software ;).
					</p>
					<h2>I can help</h2>
					<p>
						Interested in working with me? I might be available remotely or in Paris
						for an exciting open-source work.{" "}
