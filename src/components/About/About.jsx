          <h2>What I do</h2>
          <p>
            Lots of my professional experiences revolve around softwares written
            for the physical world industries such as Aerospace and Defense. In
            my current job, I maintain a web application connected to devices
            that measure indoor air quality in real time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I always try to code in the language the most suitable for each
            project, regardless of my current knowledge and preferences. I am
            most experienced in Python and Java, but in my free time I favor
            functional languages such as Erlang/Elixir/OTP, Racket and
            OCaml/ReasonML.

            I am the no bullshit type. Solid code and transparency are what
            matters to me. I measure quality by customer satisfaction. I donâ€™t
            hesitate asking questions - I do it happily as part of team work.
          </p>
          <p>
            My fuel is passion. I enjoy the most working on meaningful and
            ambitious projects.

          <h2>Why Baozi?</h2>
          <p>
            Because it is so damn tasty! What a question! And also because it
            appears simple but it is internally extremely complex like all
            pieces of software ;).
